                            <p>Whenever I open a world in 1.13.2, the game crashes. It's just fine on startup.

Hi there, recently returned to Vicky 2. Looking to try the 3.04 version and latest version of HPM, so I uninstalled and reinstalled Vicky 2 on Steam. The launcher opens normally but then will not launch the actual game. Uninstalled and reinstalled to just get the base game working. Same problem. Searched the forums for a fix and tried deleting the map cache, just the time file and then the whole folder, didn't work. Tried launching directly and got the MSVCR100.dll and MSVCP100.dll bugs. For people who try to launch the game and only get Steam's pop-up that then self terminates, I found that by going into steamapps and trying to run the NMS.exe directly, I got a "Missing msvcr100.dll" message. Long story short, goto https://www.dll-files.com/msvcr100.dll.html and download that .dll and put it in your System32 folder and your SysWOW64 folders. For me, it was already in SysWOW64, but was not in System32. It launched immediately after that. EDIT: Nothing sketchy The Wine development release 1.9.6 is now available.

EDIT: I was able to fix the problem by copying msvcp100.dll and msvcr100.dll into its file directory in the Steamapps common thingy! --- Whenever I try to run Axiom Verge, Steam does the "preparing to launch" thing for a moment, then it says "running" for a couple moments, then "syncing", then nothing. The window never opens, nor does a process. When I open the log, it says this: --- 2016-11-05 20:21:24,189 - Caught exception constructing THGame(). System.BadImageFormatException:. Edit: SOLVED. I found this link (  Only confusing thing is people on here said that their error message said missing MSVCR100.dll, not MSVCP100.dll, although mine clearly said P and not R. Evetytime I try and open ESO, I get a popup window saying "The program can't be started because MSVCP100.dll is missing" etc. I was proactive and searched how to fix this and found this (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us.
